# competitive_programming_course_answers
"234901 - Competitive Programming" course, taught by the Computer Science faculty of the Technion, presents various coding challenges with run-time and memory constraints. Using knowledge in data-structures and algorithms we solve with a mere STL library complex coding challenges. In this repository I store my answers to the problems I solved during the course. 

Note: Each problem has its .cpp & .pdf files with the challenge's description.
